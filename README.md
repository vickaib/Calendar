# Calendar
## Description
This project is a mockup of a simple office hours set up form. It allows the user to select different time slots on the landing page. Once the form is submitted, a calendar will be generated based on the current month, including the timeslots that the user selected.

## Challenges
- Styling of the layout
- Selection slots aren't emailed to the user email when submitted
